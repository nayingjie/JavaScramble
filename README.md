# JavaScramble
A program built in Java using Swing as a GUI. This program will generate scrambles for the following Rubik's cube variations:  
- 3x3x3 / Rubik's Cube
- 4x4x4 / Rubik's Revenge
- 5x5x5 / Professor Cube
- 6x6x6 / V-Cube 6
- Megaminx
- Pyraminx
- Skewb  


*NOTE: The scrambles are generated in SiGN (Simple General Notation).*  
Feel free to open an issue if you want me to add a cube variation, or send me an email at sno.kattunge@gmail.com.
